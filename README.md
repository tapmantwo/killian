Some sort of suite of testing helpers, more of a thought experiment than anything else really :)

Why?
===
Well, erm, good question.  But I thought it might be nice to create a simple set of tools that help with writing tests.

The thing is, I often see (and have written countless times myself), very complicated tests that have lots of moving parts.  These tests quickly become difficult to follow, and we start giving them crazy long names to try and help describe what the test is trying to prove and how they prove it.
The other thing is, perhaps we need our testing tools to "help" guide us about our tests.
